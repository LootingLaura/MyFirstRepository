*Noise Machine* is an experimental model of a technically augmented book that combines textual, auditory and visual elements. Likewise, *Noise Machine* is the title of the dystopian horror short story included inside the model.

The project explores new forms and possibilities of narrative structures that unfold on multiple, intertwined  levels. While most of the narration takes place on a textual level, some details, as well as crucial elements of the story, are conveyed in an auditory or graphical manner.


Noise Machine 2.0 is the latest iteration of an ongoing project. Previous versions included all technical components in an external audio player, separate from the book itself. This separation no longer exists in Version 2.0. 

All technical components are integrated into the back of the book. The components include a PCB, the Touch Board from *Bare Conductive* and a lithium polymer battery. 
The five light sensors (EVERLIGHT ITR8307) are attached to the PCB and connected to the Touch Board. The board is programmed to play a sound file when light is detected by the sensors. The perforations in the paper block ensure that, when certain pages are opened, light hits specific sensors, bringing the story to life through sound. 

The sample audio file is a 3D soundscape that can be listened to as a binaural mix through headphones. 

The visual design of the cover draws inspiration from two objects that are fundamental to the story: the round machine and its metal strings.
The book block is entirely hand-bound (Coptic binding, paper weight: 160 g/m²) and only attached to the back cover (Swiss binding).

The cover and back of the book are made of poplar plywood and were cut to shape using a laser cutter.
