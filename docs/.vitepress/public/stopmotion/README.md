Purpose
-------
Drop stop-motion PNG frames here. Files should be named exactly:

- `01.png`
- `02.png`
- `03.png`
- `04.png`

These files will be served from `/stopmotion/01.png` etc and used only by the landing page StopMotion component.

To replace frames, overwrite these files and reload the dev server (or hard-refresh the browser to avoid cache issues).
